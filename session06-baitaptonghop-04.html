              This is the accordion body of the first item. It is visible by
              default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that
              we use to style each element. These classes control the overall
              appearance, as well as showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can
              modify any of these with custom CSS or override our default variables.
              It’s also worth noting that almost any HTML can fit inside the
              accordion body, although transitions restrict overflow.
